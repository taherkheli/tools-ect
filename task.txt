Inside index.ts is a modified version of an original pull request that was declined. 
The problem with this code is first of all readability, and second the performence. 
Modifications were made to meet our requirements, so this task is only to observe the applicant's way of thinking.

Explanation of the code: 
data.ts: 
A data provider, created for this test only.

index.ts: 
The dataformat that goes into this application, is in an array of objects. 
Is was made this way, in order to be useable directly in DevExtreme (React Component Library) DataTree Component.

The data (dataStore) contains a flattened version of a nested JSON object:
dataStore = [
    { Key_ID = 1, Head_ID = -1, ID="...", ... },
    { Key_ID = 2, Head_ID = 1, ID="...", ... },
    { Key_ID = 3, Head_ID = 2, ID="...", ... },
    { Key_ID = 4, Head_ID = 1, ID="...", ... },
    { Key_ID = 5, Head_ID = 4, ID="...", ... }
]

JSON object:
{ 
    "Children": 
    [
        {
            "Description": "ABC1",
            "Display_Value: "ABC1",
            "Children": 
            [
                {
                    "Global_ID": "global_abcd",
                    "Display_Value: "True",
                    "Children": []
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "Description": "ABC2",
            "Display_Value: "ABC2",
            "Children": 
            [
                {
                    "Global_ID": "global_abcd",
                    "Display_Value: "False",
                    "Children": []
                }
            ]
        },
    ]
}

The code's task, is to analyse all global IDs.
For all identical global IDs, it must append the Display_Value of that object to all the others.
This way, when analyzeGlobalData has been called, it will be easy to display global inconsistencies.

Output after analyzeGlobalData: 
{ 
    "Children": 
    [
        {
            "Description": "ABC1",
            "Display_Value: "ABC1",
            "Children": 
            [
                {
                    "Global_ID": "global_abcd",
                    "Display_Value: "True",
                    "ABC2": "True",
                    "Children": []
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "Description": "ABC2",
            "Display_Value: "ABC2",
            "Children": 
            [
                {
                    "Global_ID": "global_abcd",
                    "Display_Value: "False",
                    "ABC1": "True"
                    "Children": []
                }
            ]
        },
    ]
}

Explanation of the task: 
As seen from the execution time, it takes a long time to execute the analyzeGlobalData function.
The test is setup to create a set 500000 different objects, which is not far off from large real systems.

The task is to modify the code to archive multiple goals: 
1: Increase the readability
2: Decrease execution time

You are allowed to modify in both data.ts and index.ts;
the only requirement is that the final data is delivered in the flattened version
